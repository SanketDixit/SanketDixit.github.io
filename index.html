                <p>
                    I am a highly proficient back-end developer with deep expertise in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), Java,
                    and MicroServices, primarily developed using Spring Boot and AWS Lambdas. Over the years, I have worked
                    extensively across industries such as e-commerce, retail, insurance, and travel, designing and deploying
                    scalable, high-performance applications. My technical acumen spans the full software development lifecycle,
                    from initial architecture design to final deployment and maintenance, leveraging object-oriented programming
                    principles and the latest technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I have successfully led cross-functional teams in various capacities,
                    including Technical Lead, Solution Architect, and Scrum Master. I am adept at guiding teams through complex
                    projects, fostering collaboration, and ensuring timely delivery of innovative solutions that meet business needs.
                    My leadership and problem-solving abilities allow me to bridge the gap between technical execution and strategic vision,
                    driving successful outcomes for both clients and stakeholders.
